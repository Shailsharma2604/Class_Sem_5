What is String,StringBuilder, and StringBuffer:-
    
    String:-
            Immutable:-
                    Once we create a String object, we can't perform any changes in the existing object.
                    If we are trying to perform any changes with those changes, a new object will be created. 
                    So, String objects are immutable objects.
    StringBuilder:-
            Mutable:-
                    Once we create a StringBuilder object, we can perform any changes in the existing object.
                    So, StringBuilder objects are mutable objects.
    StringBuffer:-
            Mutable:-
                    Once we create a StringBuffer object, we can perform any changes in the existing object.
                    So, StringBuffer objects are mutable objects.
            Thread-safe:-
                    StringBuffer is thread-safe. So, StringBuffer objects are thread-safe objects.
