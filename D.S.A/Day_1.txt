- Java Editions:
    1. Standard Edition : Used by us 
    2. Micro Edition : Not used now 
    3. Smart card Edition
    4. Enterprise Edition : Used by web distributed apps 

- Text block: 
    - Introduced in Java 13
    - Used to write multiline strings
    - Uses """ to start and end the block
    - Can be used to write HTML, JSON, SQL queries etc.

- Java is divided into dev part and execution part
    - Dev part is done by JDK
    - Execution part is done by JRE

# Is loader and linker same as compiler
- Loader and linker are not same as compiler
- Compiler is used to convert source code to machine code
- Loader is used to load the machine code into memory
- Linker is used to link the machine code with other required libraries

# Primitive data types:
- byte: 1 byte
- short: 2 bytes
- int: 4 bytes
- long: 8 bytes
- float: 4 bytes
- double: 8 bytes
- char: 2 bytes             // 2 because of utf-16 (Unicode Transfer Format) encoding ; Java allows us to write variable name in any lang and hence we need more size, so utf-16
- boolean: 1 bit

# Non primitive data types:
- String                // null by default
- Array
- Class
- Interface
- Enum

- Whenever an obj is not used in java, it undergoes garbage collection
- Garbage collection is done by JVM

- int a;            // Java will not assign any default value to a because it performs garbage collection for this as it is not initialized or used 

- calling a static method or static variable do not requires a object 

- Declaring constant:
    - final int a = 10;        // final keyword is used to declare a constant
    - a = 20;                  // This will give an error as a is a constant

- Variable storage in Java: 
    - Stack: 
        - Stores method calls and local variables
        - Stores primitive datatypes
        - Faster access
        - Limited memory
    - Heap:
        - Stores objects and global variables
        - Stores non-primitive datatypes
        - Slower access
        - Large memory

- Memories:
    - Primary memory 
    - Secondary memory
    - Cache memory

- Types of Cache:
    - L1 cache: Fastest, smallest
    - L2 cache: Slower, larger
    - L3 cache: Slowest, largest

- Cache is fastest because it is present in the CPU

- Resistors are used to store data in the form of 0 and 1. They are extremely fast because memory storage location is fixed and hence we can access it quickly.
