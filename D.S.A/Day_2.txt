Bitwise operators :-

 - in Java are used to perform operations on individual bits of integer (int and long) data types. 


~ 5 = -6

2's complement of 5 is -6

0101 -> 1010
1010 -> 101
101 -> 5

-6 = 1010
1010 -> 0101

Left shift (2<<3):- 
                    2x2^3 = 16


right shift (2>>3):-
                    2/2^3 = 0
            (9>>3) = 1


deep copy and shallow copy

deep copy:- 
            It is a process in which the copying process occurs recursively.
            It means first constructing a new collection object and then, 
            recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original.
            In case of deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object.

shallow copy:-
                A shallow copy of an object is a copy of the object itself, but not of the objects to which it refers.
                If the original object contains references to other objects, the shallow copy will copy these references into the new object.
                Both the original and the copied object will refer to the same instances of those referenced objects.
                Changes made to the referenced objects through one object will reflect in the other.
